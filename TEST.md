## 3DStreet Asset Work, Test Project

This is a simple test project to evaluate your ability to contribute models to 3DStreet.

### Milestone 1:

1. Watch the instructional video and follow along: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VuSwrNL567EcYXN6LaNk9FQDwKGFDHTF/view?usp=sharing
2. The deliverable will be sourced from this asset library which we have licensed: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QqpDsk0jE1IlvN4KqlyDdr-6RYMX47g0/view?usp=sharing (you must request access and keep these files private, do not commit any source files to github repo)
3. Download this pack, unzip, and load the demo scene fbx into Blender

### Milestone 2:

4. Follow the instructions from the video (from milestone 1) but this time use the pre-configured buildings from the fbx demo scene "POLYGON_City_Demo_Scene.fbx"
5. Create 6 separate isolated standalone building models (similar or identical to the instructional video) and place model centerpoint on ground and center of front of building 
6. Consolidate into the 1 atlas texture, remove references to any additional texture such as air conditioner fan (just use gray color instead, for example), or you can also add small texture like a fan to the base atlas. The point is we want as few textures as possible, ideally 1.

### Milestone 3:

7. Export as both glb and gltf with separate bin and jpeg/png.
8. Test with sample A-Frame project to make sure the exported files appear correct and meet draw call / geometry count goals
9. Share for feedback and make further revisions as instructed.
